# MVC Blog
For this assigment we were tasked with creating a blog website with users, posts, and comments for the posts using a SQL database with queries performed using sequelize. For displaying the data on the UI we were tasked with using Handlebars which required us to create controllers with routing information for the pages which were connected to the backend using our API.

## Usage
The app can be cloned from my GitHub repo. At this time it is unfinished as I was experiencing some bugs in the models which will require some review. However, there is functionality for Signing up, Logging in, and Creating posts.
